# GUI Features

PAROL6 is a high-performance 3D-printed desktop robotic arm. The design approach of PAROL6 was to be similar to industrial robots in terms of mechanical design, control software, and usability. Control software, GUI, and robots STL files are open-source. You can build your own PAROL6 robot by following the instructions on this [page](https://github.com/PCrnjak/PAROL6-Desktop-robot-arm/tree/main/Building%20instructions).
